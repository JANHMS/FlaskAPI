# REST-API-Flask

This is a simple RESTful Application build with the lightweight framework flask. 
In is an application basics of CRUD are implemented. 

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete 

It was used to understand and learn RESTful Applications. 

However this is more and more replcaed by GQL designed Web Applications, which I implmented later in another project with ruby on rails in the BE.
