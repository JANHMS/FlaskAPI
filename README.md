# REST-API-Flask

This is a simple RESTAPI Application build with the lightweight framework flask. 
Is is an application which follows the basics of CRUD. 
It was used to understand and learn RESTful Applications. 

However this is replcaed by GQL designed Web Applications, which I later in another project also implmented with ruby on rails in the BE.
